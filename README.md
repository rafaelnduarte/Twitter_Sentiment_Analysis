This kind of analysis is extremely useful nowadays, since we have overwhelming amounts of data coming out of social media, where people are constantly expressing their feelings towards other people, companies, situations, politics, and many other subjects.

> The goal of this project is to analyze the public opinion on President Trump amidst the Corovanavirus global pandemic.

The dataset was obtained by me using the [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) library, and the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started). The data was retrieved on April 20th 2020.
